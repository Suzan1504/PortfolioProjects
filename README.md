**PROJECT DESCRIPTION**

In the wake of the global COVID-19 pandemic, understanding the impact of the virus and the efficacy of vaccination campaigns has become crucial. This project aims to analyze COVID-19 related data, focusing on death rates and vaccination progress across the world. Utilizing SQL for data manipulation and analysis, combined with the powerful visualization capabilities of Tableau, this project provides insightful observations into how different regions and countries have been affected by and are recovering from the pandemic.


**OBJECTIVES**

Compare COVID-19 death rates globally, identifying trends, patterns, and anomalies over time across different countries and regions.
Forecast future death rates using statistical models and data analysis to predict the potential impact of COVID-19 in the short and long term.
Analyze factors influencing death rates, such as vaccination rates, etc.
Provide insights and actionable information to policymakers, healthcare professionals, and the public.
